## Requirements
For this package to work, it is required that you first install the following:
- [Source-Python](http://downloads.sourcepython.com/)
- [Warcraft-Source](https://github.com/ThaPwned/WCS)
- [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php)
- [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (The 32-Bit Version)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145) This is only if you are running a Windows Server, elsewise ignore this step.



## Step-by-step installation guide
1. Go to your csgo or cstrike directory (NOTE! Some servers name this directory the server's IP instead).

2. Drag and drop the four folders named: "addons", "cfg", "materials", and "sound" in to the directory.

3. Now go in to your csgo/cfg directory.

4. Copy all the contents found within the autoexec_wcs.cfg and put it in the top of your autoexec.cfg. (If you don't have an autoexec.cfg then simply rename autoexec_wcs.cfg to autoexec.cfg)

5. Copy all the contents found within the server_wcs.cfg and put it inside of your server.cfg.

6. Now restart your server, a server restart is necessary a reload won't do. 
   OBS: The first time you restart your server after adding the Emulator to it you will have to restart the server twice to fully work.

## Some Additional Side Notes
1. You can also use the EventScripts API in Source.Python plugins.

2. Unlike EventScripts this emulator also supports CS:GO.
   Though, es.usermsg()/es_usermsg is not supported. Instead please use the usermsg library directly.

3. Ayuto took the original EventScripts libraries from the latest release and adapted them to work with Python 3.
   Ayuto have also removed the example addons like ``mugmod`` or ``slingshot`` to keep it simple.

4. Some differences from the original EventScripts version:
   A possible crash has also been fixed when using handles.
   es.getuserid() also works with SteamID3.
